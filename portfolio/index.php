            	<p>"This is the dimension of imagination. It is an area which we call the Twilight Zone." Okay, so it may not be the Twilight Zone, but it is a dimension of imagination and creativity. I am passionate about the internet, about websites, about all digital things; it's what I love. I enjoy taking a customer's needs and goals, throwing in some creativity, merging them with the latest technology and solving problems - ultimately, leaving a wonderful product behind that both the customer and their consumer can be happy about.</p>
            	<p>Some of the sites I have worked on are large; I'm talking international, multi-million dollar, millions of hits... large. Yet, I love that I am able to work on everyday sites for friends and family, too. Whether it be for a small business owner or someone just looking to have a place to post family photos or a resume. Below you will find a small sampling of where my imagination and creativity has taken me.</p>
