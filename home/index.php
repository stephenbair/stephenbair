	                        <div class="two-column">
		                        <p>A bona fide code warrior, Stephen was designing great customer experiences before he knew there was a word for it. He feeds his passion for simple, easy-to-use web interaction by solving digital roadblocks in creative ways.</p>
								<p>His career took off in 2005 after helping launch a major brand redesign for XM Satellite Radio. Later, he led a bi-coastal team of developers for eBay Enterprise, delivering multi-million dollar website redesigns and updates for clients such as Dick’s Sporting Goods, Kenneth Cole, Levi Strauss, Toys R Us, and many other top brands and retailers around the world.
								A natural-born problem squasher, Stephen digs his gig because it’s all about finding the right technology and mastering it to generate results for clients.</p>
								<p>When he’s off the clock, you can find Bair snowboarding, motorcycling and volunteering as a “Mr. Fix-It” at his small town community theater. And oh, earning a United States patent or two.</p>
